Looking at your PowerShell terminal, you’re encountering a Git error that says “cannot lock ref ‘refs/remotes/origin/release/release_2.4.0.1’”. This is a common Git issue that occurs when there’s a lock file preventing Git operations or when another Git process is running.

Here are the steps to fix this:

## Method 1: Check for running Git processes

First, make sure no other Git processes are running:

```powershell
# Check for running git processes
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like "*git*"}
```

If you find any, close them or use Task Manager to end the processes.

## Method 2: Remove Git lock files

Navigate to your repository and remove any lock files:

```powershell
# Navigate to your git directory
cd "C:\DEV\PriSM_api\.git"

# Remove lock files
Remove-Item -Path "refs\remotes\origin\release\release_2.4.0.1.lock" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Path "index.lock" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Path "HEAD.lock" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Also check the packed-refs.lock file
Remove-Item -Path "packed-refs.lock" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

## Method 3: Clean up the specific reference

Try removing the problematic reference:

```powershell
cd "C:\DEV\PriSM_api"
git update-ref -d refs/remotes/origin/release/release_2.4.0.1
```

## Method 4: Force cleanup and retry

If the above doesn’t work, try:

```powershell
cd "C:\DEV\PriSM_api"
git gc --prune=now
git remote prune origin
git pull --rebase
```

After trying these steps, you should be able to run your `git pull --rebase` command successfully. The most likely cause is a leftover lock file from a previous Git operation that was interrupted.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
